**Version 2025-01**
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Issued by:** Finance & Human Resources

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This Travel & Expense Policy outlines the standards and procedures that all ACME AG employees must follow when incurring expenses on behalf of the company. The objective of this policy is to:

* Ensure fair and consistent treatment of all employees.
* Provide clarity on allowable expenses and reimbursement procedures.
* Support cost-effective decision-making while enabling employees to travel safely and efficiently.
* Comply with Swiss financial regulations and company audit requirements.

This policy applies to all ACME AG employees, contractors, and consultants undertaking business-related travel or submitting expenses for reimbursement.

## 2. General Principles

* **Prudent Use of Funds:** Employees are expected to spend company money with the same care as if it were their own.
* **Business Relevance:** Expenses must have a clear and direct connection to company business activities.
* **Transparency:** Receipts and supporting documentation must accompany claims as outlined in this policy.
* **Compliance:** Failure to comply may result in rejection of claims or, in cases of repeated violations, disciplinary action.

## 3. Accommodation (Hotels)

ACME AG recognizes that accommodation is a key component of business travel.

* **Switzerland:** Hotel costs are reimbursable up to **CHF 250 per night**.
* **Elsewhere in Europe:** Hotel costs are reimbursable up to **CHF 200 per night**.

Employees should book standard rooms in mid-range hotels that offer reasonable comfort, safety, and proximity to business activities.

**Not reimbursable:**

* Luxury or premium room categories (e.g., suites).
* In-room entertainment, minibar purchases, or spa services.

**Example:**

* An employee traveling to Zurich for a two-night conference may book a hotel charging CHF 230/night. This is within the CHF 250 Swiss limit and fully reimbursable.
* An employee traveling to Paris books a hotel charging CHF 260/night. Since the Europe limit is CHF 200, the additional CHF 60/night requires prior manager approval.

---

## 4. Flights

Air travel should balance employee comfort and cost efficiency.

* **Trips under 6 hours:** Employees must book **Economy Class**.
* **Trips exceeding 6 hours:** Employees may book **Premium Economy**, subject to **manager approval**.
* **Business Class** is not permitted except under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., medical reasons) and requires written approval from both the manager and Finance.

Employees are encouraged to book flights well in advance to secure cost-effective fares.

**Example:**

* A 5-hour flight from Zurich to Madrid should be booked in Economy.
* A 7-hour flight from Zurich to New York may be booked in Premium Economy, provided prior approval is obtained.

---

## 5. Meals and Per Diem

To cover meals and incidental expenses during business travel, ACME AG provides daily allowances:

* **CHF 75/day** for domestic travel within Switzerland.
* **CHF 90/day** for international travel.

Employees are not required to submit meal receipts when claiming per diem. However, alcohol expenses are **not reimbursable** under any circumstances.

**Example:**

* An employee on a 3-day trip to Geneva may claim CHF 225 (3 × CHF 75).
* An employee on a 5-day trip to Berlin may claim CHF 450 (5 × CHF 90).

---

## 6. Ground Transportation

Employees should prioritize safe and efficient travel methods while maintaining cost awareness.

* **Public Transport:** Trains, trams, and buses should be used whenever practical.
* **Taxis/Ride-hailing:** May be used after **22:00**, when public transport is unavailable, or if the employee is carrying **heavy equipment**.

Employees must choose standard service options rather than premium categories.

**Example:**

* Taking a taxi at 23:00 from the airport to the hotel is reimbursable.
* Using a taxi at 14:00 for a short journey that could be completed by tram is **not reimbursable**.

---

## 7. Approvals and Oversight

* **Manager Approval:** Required for any exception to standard limits (e.g., higher hotel rate, Premium Economy flight).
* **Finance Audit:** All claims exceeding **CHF 1,500** are subject to detailed audit by Finance.
* **Pre-Trip Approvals:** For international travel, employees must secure pre-trip approval from their manager before booking flights and accommodation.

---

## 8. Receipts and Documentation

To ensure transparency, receipts must be submitted for all expenses of **CHF 25 or more**.

* Receipts should clearly state the date, vendor, amount, and currency.
* Electronic receipts are acceptable if they are legible and complete.
* Credit card statements are not valid substitutes for receipts.

Failure to provide receipts may result in non-reimbursement.

## 9. Non-Reimbursable Expenses

Examples of expenses that will not be reimbursed include:

* Alcoholic beverages.
* Personal entertainment (movies, streaming services, etc.).
* Health club or spa services.
